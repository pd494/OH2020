# OmegaHacks2020
Go into OmegaHacks folder, then go into the 'src' folder. The two source code files are located in 'src' and they are called TeacherInterface.java, and StudentInterface.java Those are the classes that need to be compiled. All other files within 'src' are images, and needed to be downloaded and placed within the same directory as TeacherInterface and StudentInterface.java, so the two files can compile and run. The two classes will not run if the images are not downloaded and placed in the same directory that TeacherInterface and StudentInterface are in. Make sure to download all the other files within src, and place them within the directory that TeacherInterface and StudentInterface are in.






Make sure to also go over the Project Proposal, which explains the gist and logistics of our app LockTest. It is also located in the OmegaHacks folder.
