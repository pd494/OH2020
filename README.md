LockTest
25th May 2020
PRODUCT OVERVIEW
As a result of the recent pandemic, schools throughout the world have been shut down and many students are now having to switch to education on online platforms. During this effort, however, many teachers and schools are unable to assign tests to their students, due to the possibilities of academic dishonesty and technological trouble.  With the help of LockTest, teachers will be able to successfully assign tests to their students without the worry of compromising the integrity of the examination. This will help to recreate the learning experience and milestones that students need to progress within their online classes. 
GOALS
Offer a safe and efficient platform for Test-taking services that is user-friendly for both students and teachers.
Allow Schools to administer tests without having to worry about academic dishonesty. 
SPECIFICATIONS
LockTest is a software that allows teachers to create graded assignments and examinations while being able to proctor their students as they take their evaluations. The LockTest software allows for teachers to monitor the students as they take the tests.
Teacher Interface
The teacher interface begins with a screen displaying all of the tests that the teacher has planned and is planning for the students in their classes. Teachers can then click on the “Create New Exam” button in order to create and assign an examination. After proceeding to the test-creation screen, teachers are able to type in their questions and add more questions as they please. Also, teachers have the option of deciding what happens to the student’s test if they attempt to open another application. They can either choose to close their test, clear their answers, or do both. 
Student Interface
On the other side of things, the student interface begins with a screen in which the student is presented with all the classes he/she is enrolled in for the school year. The student can then click on one of his/her classes to be transferred to a page showing the assignments that are currently assigned to the student and those that were assigned to the student in the past. To take the test, the student can click on the exam that is assigned to them. In the test, the picture at the top of the screen resembles the live feed of the webcam that allows teachers to look at the students as they take the test, a feature that would help prevent other possible forms of cheating. Because the goal of our software is to prevent academic dishonesty, the student is unable to copy and paste responses into the short answer questions. Adding on, the student’s exam progress will be cleared if the student attempts to open other applications outside of the test panel, based on what the teacher has selected during the creation of the test. As the time runs out at the bottom, the student will be redirected to the home page, marking the end of a successful test. 

POTENTIAL
Although we could not implement this feature with the time we had left, the teacher will also have a page during the actual examination showing the students in his/her class as they take the test. It will be done with the use of web cameras on the local device the student is using to take the test. This feature is another step we are taking to prevent academic dishonesty and allow schools to safely administer tests to students.
